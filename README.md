# Remote Sensing: A Tutorial

In order to start working on the notebook, first make sure you have [jupyter installed](https://jupyter.org/install). Create a Python environment using [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) or [venv](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43069780/how-to-create-virtual-env-with-python3) and [add it to jupyter](https://archive.is/L9Rqv). Now you can start working.

First, clone the github repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/maybemkl/rs-mtl-atc.git 
```

Next, start the virtual environment and install all dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now, launch jupyter and start the tutorial!
